# Book Library Web Application

This is a simple book libray web app that allows a book-keeper to add view the list of books in the library as well as add new books and delete old ones.

This was a project that extended the tutorial of NetNinja regarding DOM manipulation, that's why I used vanilla JS for this project. I extened it by making it a full CRUD application.

The tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gfoKa5la9dsdCNpuey2s-V).

The backend is written in Spring Boot.
